# D-CON German Concurrency Theory Meetup

D-CON is a series of annual informal two-day meetings (by now, traditionally, in March) that essentially serve the purpose to stimulate exchange and discussions, especially among PhD students in the field, and to foster collaborations.

D-CON is organized by [GI Fachgruppe Concurrency Theory]({% link _organizations/gi-fachgruppe.md %})
The founders were Barbara König, Michael Mendler, Markus Müller-Olm and Uwe Nestmann.
