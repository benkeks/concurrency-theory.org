## Description

TRENDS 2018 is an event organised by[ IFIP WG 1.8](https://www.concurrency-theory.org/organizations/ifip) on Concurrency Theory. It aims at bringing together researchers interested in Concurrency Theory and its applications, to exchange ideas and discuss recent trends and open problems. The event will take place on September 8, 2018 and will consist of two invited talks, a number of highlight presentations. It will be associated with the yearly WG 1.8 business meeting.

  Title: Behavioural Type-Based Static Verification Framework for Go
  
  Abstract: Go is a production-level statically typed programming language whose design features explicit message-passing primitives and lightweight threads, enabling (and encouraging) programmers to develop concurrent systems where components interact through communication more so than by lock-based shared memory concurrency. Go can detect global deadlocks at runtime, but does not provide any compile-time protection against all too common communication mismatches and partial deadlocks.
  In this work we present a static verification framework for liveness and safety in Go programs, able to detect communication errors and deadlocks by model checking. Our toolchain infers from a Go program a faithful representation of its communication patterns as behavioural types, where the types are model checked for liveness and safety.

  Title: Risk management for high tech systems

  Abstract:

  How do we ensure that self-driving cars, nuclear power plants and Internet-of-things devices are safe and reliable? That is the topic of risk management. Fault tree analysis is a very popular technique here, deployed by many institutions like NASA, ESA, Honeywell, Ford, Airbus, the FDA, Toyota, Shell etc.
  In this presentation, I will elaborate how the deployment of stochastic model checking can improve the capabilities of fault tree analysis, making them more powerful, flexible and efficient, allowing one to analyze a richer variety of questions faster, and thereby increasing their practical relevance and deployment in practical risk assessments.
  I will report on our experience with the application and validation of these techniques in industrial practice. Finally, I will present some ideas on the deployment of big data analytics within fault tree analysis.

* 15:30-16:00 **Coffee / Tea Break**

* 16:00-16:30 **IFIP WG 1.8 Business Meeting (Open to Public)**

## IFIP WG 1.8 on Concurrency Theory

The aims of IFIP WG 1.8 on Concurrency Theory are:

* To develop theoretical foundations of concurrency, exploring frontiers of existing theoretical models like process algebra and process calculi, so as to obtain a deeper theoretical understanding of concurrent and parallel systems.

* To promote and coordinate the exchange of information on concurrency theory, by sharing ideas, discussing open problems, and identifying future directions of research in the area.

The activities of this WG encompass all aspects of concurrency theory and its applications.
