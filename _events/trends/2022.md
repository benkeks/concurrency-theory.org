# The 11th IFIP WG 1.8 Workshop on Trends in Concurrency Theory

<strong>September 12, 2022, Warsaw, Poland</strong>

**A satellite event of [CONFEST 2022](https://confest2022.mimuw.edu.pl/)**


## Description

TRENDS 2022 is an event organised by [IFIP WG 1.8](https://www.concurrency-theory.org/organizations/ifip) on Concurrency Theory. It aims at bringing together researchers interested in Concurrency Theory and its applications, to exchange ideas and discuss recent trends and open problems. The event will take place on September 12, 2022. It will be associated with the yearly WG 1.8 business meeting.

  **Title:** State Complexity of Population Protocols

  Population protocols were introduced by Angluin et al. in 2004 to
  study the theoretical properties of networks of mobile sensors with
  very limited computational resources. They have also been proposed
  as a natural computing model, with molecules, cells, or
  microorganisms playing the role of sensors.

  In a population protocol an arbitrary number of indistinguishable,
  finite-state agents interact randomly in pairs to collectively
  decide if their initial global configuration satisfies a given
  property. The property is formalized as a predicate that maps each
  initial configuration to an output, $0$ or $1$.  Starting from an
  initial configuration, the agents eventually agree to the correct
  output almost surely, and continue producing it forever. The
  protocol is said to stabilize to the correct output.

  It is well known that population protocols can decide exactly the
  semilinear predicates, or, equivalently, the predicates expressible
  in Presburger arithmetic. Current research concentrates on
  investigating the amount of resources needed to decide a given
  predicate. The standard resources, time and memory, translate for
  population protocols into expected time to stabilization, usually
  called parallel runtime, and number of states of each agent. In this
  talk I present upper and lower bounds for the state complexity of
  population protocols.

  **Title:** Strategies in Countable MDPs

  Markov decision processes (MDPs) are a standard model for dynamic
  systems that exhibit both stochastic and nondeterministic
  behavior. For MDPs with finite state space it is known that for a
  wide range of objectives there exist optimal strategies that are
  memoryless and deterministic. In contrast, if the state space is
  infinite, optimal strategies may not exist, and optimal or
  epsilon-optimal strategies may require (possibly infinite)
  memory. This gives rise to a reach landscape of strategy complexity:
  how much memory is required, in the worst case, to play optimally or
  epsilon-optimally? In this talk we discuss strategies with optimal
  strategy complexity for countable MDPs, building on strategies for
  finite MDPs. We focus on qualitative objectives such as
  reachability, safety, (co-)B체chi, and other parity objectives.

  Joint work with Richard Mayr, Mahsa Shirmohammadi, Patrick Totzke,
  Dominik Wojtczak.

## IFIP WG 1.8 on Concurrency Theory

The aims of IFIP WG 1.8 on Concurrency Theory are:

* To develop theoretical foundations of concurrency, exploring frontiers of existing theoretical models like process algebra and process calculi, so as to obtain a deeper theoretical understanding of concurrent and parallel systems.

* To promote and coordinate the exchange of information on concurrency theory, by sharing ideas, discussing open problems, and identifying future directions of research in the area.

The activities of this WG encompass all aspects of concurrency theory and its applications.
