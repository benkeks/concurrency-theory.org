## Description

TRENDS 2019 is an event organised by[ IFIP WG 1.8](https://www.concurrency-theory.org/organizations/ifip) on Concurrency Theory. It aims at bringing together researchers interested in Concurrency Theory and its applications, to exchange ideas and discuss recent trends and open problems. The event will take place on August 31, 2019 and will consist of three invited talks and a number of highlight presentations. It will be associated with the yearly WG 1.8 business meeting.

## Invited Speakers

* **Laura Bocchi**, University of Kent, UK

  Title: Time-sensitive protocol design and implementation

  In this talk I will discuss ongoing work towards establishing relationships between models for real-time asynchronous interactions and their implementations. We will consider models based on two partly related formalisms: Timed Session Types and Communicating Timed Automata (CTA). For CTA the relationship between models and (abstractions of) programs can be expressed as a refinement relation. I will discuss decidable conditions under which refinement preserves behaviour and progress properties, providing us with guidelines on how to safely implement timed protocols expressed as CTA. For Timed Session Types the model/program relationship is the type-checking of programs against (behavioural) types. I will present a theory timed asynchronous session types for a realistic calculus and discuss open challenges and future directions​

  Title: Towards the Automated Synthesis of Probabilistic Programs

  Probabilistic model checking focuses on checking whether a given (mostly
  finite) probabilistic model satisfies a given specification. Efficient
  algorithms and powerful tools such as PRISM and STORM exist and have
  been applied to various case studies. These techniques do require
  however the existence of a probabilistic model.

  In this talk, I will focus on the automatic synthesis of Markov chains
  that satisfy a specification. This includes program sketching: given a
  partial probabilistic program with "holes", fill these "holes" such that
  the resulting program satisfies the specification.

  I will outline two approaches: counterexample-guided abstraction
  refinement (CEGAR) and counterexample-guided inductive synthesis
  (CEGIS). The CEGAR approach iteratively partitions the design space
  starting from an abstraction of this space and refines this by a
  light-weight analysis of verification results. The CEGIS technique
  exploits critical subsystems as counterexamples to prune all programs
  behaving incorrectly on that input.

  We show the applicability of these synthesis techniques to sketching of
  probabilistic programs, controller synthesis of POMDPs, and analysis of
  software product lines.

  Title: Fixpoint Games

  Solving fixpoint equations is a recurring problem in several domains:
  the result of a dataflow analysis can be characterized as either a
  least or greatest fixpoint. It is well-known that bisimilarity - the
  largest bisimulation - admits a characterization as a greatest
  fixpoint and furthermore mu-calculus model-checking requires to solve
  systems of nested fixpoint equations.

  Often, these fixpoint equations or equation systems are defined over
  powerset lattices, however in several applications - such as
  lattice-valued or real-valued mu-calculi - the lattice under
  consideration is not a powerset.

  Hence we extend the notion of fixpoint games (or unfolding games,
  introduced by Venema) to games for equation systems over more general
  lattices. In particular continuous lattices admit a very elegant
  characterization of the solution.

  We will also describe how to define progress measures which describe
  winning strategies for the existential players and explain how
  abstractions and up-to functions can be integrated into the
  framework. Finally, we will sketch a local algorithm for showing
  whether a given lattice element is below the solution.

## IFIP WG 1.8 on Concurrency Theory

The aims of IFIP WG 1.8 on Concurrency Theory are:

* To develop theoretical foundations of concurrency, exploring frontiers of existing theoretical models like process algebra and process calculi, so as to obtain a deeper theoretical understanding of concurrent and parallel systems.

* To promote and coordinate the exchange of information on concurrency theory, by sharing ideas, discussing open problems, and identifying future directions of research in the area.

The activities of this WG encompass all aspects of concurrency theory and its applications.

More information on IFIP WG 1.8 can be found on its [home page](https://www.concurrency-theory.org/organizations/ifip).
