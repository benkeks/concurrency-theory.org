# The 12th IFIP WG 1.8 Workshop on Trends in Concurrency Theory

<strong>September 23, 2023, Antwerp, Belgium</strong>

**A satellite event of [CONFEST 2023](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/conferences/confest-2023/)**


## Description

TRENDS 2023 is an event organised by [IFIP WG 1.8](https://www.concurrency-theory.org/organizations/ifip) on Concurrency Theory. It aims at bringing together researchers interested in Concurrency Theory and its applications, to exchange ideas and discuss recent trends and open problems. The event will take place on September 23, 2023. It will be associated with the yearly WG 1.8 business meeting.

  **Title:** Principles of Persistent Programming

  Persistent programming is the art of developing programs that operate on persistent (non-volatile)
  states that survive program termination, be it planned or abrupt (e.g. due to a power failure).
  Persistent programming poses several important challenges: 1) persistent systems have complex—and
  often unspecified—semantics in that operations do not generally persist in their execution order;
  2) software bugs in persistent settings can lead to permanent data corruption; and 3) traditional
  testing techniques are inapplicable in persistent settings. Can formal methods come to the rescue?

  **Title:** Intersection and Simple types

  When, in the seventies of the last century, Coppo and Dezani designed intersection types, their main
  motivation was to extend the typability power of simple types, adding them an intersection connective,
  enjoying associativity, commutativity and idempotency, so denoting set formation. In fact, the simple
  types system can be seen as a restriction of the intersection type system where all sets are
  singletons. Quite early intersection types turned out to be useful in characterizing qualitative
  properties of λ-calculus, like solvability and strong normalization, and in describing models of λ-
  calculus in various settings. A variant of intersection types, where the intersection is no more
  idempotent, has been recently used to explore quantitative properties of programming language, like the
  length of the normalisation procedure. It is natural to ask if there is a quantitative version of the
  simple type system, or more precisely a decidable restriction of non-idempotent intersection system
  with the same typability power of simple types. Since the lack of idempotency, now the intersection
  corresponds to multiset formation, so (extending the previous reasoning) the natural answer is to
  restrict the multiset formation to copies of the same type. But this answer is false, the so obtained
  system is decidable, but it has less typability power than simple types. We prove that the desired
  system is obtained by restricting the multiset formation to equivalent types, where the equivalence is
  an extension of the identity, modulo the cardinality of multisets.

  **Title:** The Way to Go?

  Concurrent/distributed programming is ubiquitous nowadays. Despite the many results and insights of
  Concurrency Theory over the last decades, there is still a (too) large gap between theory and
  applications.  This talk addresses possibilities and experiences to bridge this gap in the area of
  (more or less) mainstream programming languages, looking at it from a process calculus perspective.

## IFIP WG 1.8 on Concurrency Theory

The aims of IFIP WG 1.8 on Concurrency Theory are:

* To develop theoretical foundations of concurrency, exploring frontiers of existing theoretical models like process algebra and process calculi, so as to obtain a deeper theoretical understanding of concurrent and parallel systems.

* To promote and coordinate the exchange of information on concurrency theory, by sharing ideas, discussing open problems, and identifying future directions of research in the area.

The activities of this WG encompass all aspects of concurrency theory and its applications.

More information on IFIP WG 1.8 can be found on its [home page](https://www.concurrency-theory.org/organizations/ifip).
